#opsu!dance
fork of [opsu!](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu) with cursordancing auto.  
I make cursordancing video's -[example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oFH58X_lTY)-, but I have too many requests and this way I can give people the opportunity to just run it and see the result instead of waiting for me to make a video. Original bot is written in C# and videos are made on osu!, but I don't want to distribute that program, because I don't want to endorse cheating in any way. The sources found in this repo are very representative of the ones of my bot (most files are the exact same, except for C#/java changes).  
  
You can find general (run/build) instructions in the original [opsu! README](README-OPSU.md).  

###Credits
opsu! was made by Jeffrey Han ([@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu)). All game concepts and designs are based on work by osu! developer Dean Herbert. Other opsu! credits can be found [here](CREDITS.md).  
opsu!dance (everything in the src package yugecin.opsudance) was made by me ([@yugecin](https://github.com/yugecin)). Originally in C#, now ported to java. Some edits were made in the opsu! sources.
